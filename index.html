  Aspen was conceived by Phyllis Johnson, a former editor for Women's Wear Daily and Advertising Age. 
   Each issue had a new designer and editor. “Aspen,” Johnson said, “should be a time capsule of a certain period, point of view, or person.”

      This is a web version of Aspen, a multimedia magazine of the arts published by Phyllis Johnson from 1965 to 1971. Each issue came in a customized box filled with booklets, phonograph recordings, posters, postcards — one issue even included a spool of Super-8 movie film. It's all here.

           The ads, stashed at the bottom of the box, were easily ignored. And although Aspen was supposed to publish quarterly, in reality the publication date of each issue was as much of a surprise as the contents.

   Except for two recordings — a jam by the Bill Evans Trio and a reading by William S. Burroughs — all were made expressly for Aspen. All the Aspen recordings are included here in forty audio exhibits, in both Real Audio and mp3 formats. (You will find two links to each mp3 file, “mp3” and “alt mp3”. Try both and use the one that works best for you.)

The recordings can be divided into six categories: spoken word recordings, electronic music, classical music, psychedelic music, jazz music, and avant-pop music.
  SPOKEN WORD: 9 artists, 14 recordings. Recordings of the spoken voice make up fourteen exhibits. Eleven of these capture the voice of an author reading from a previously published work: you can hear the voice of artist Marcel Duchamp, Constructivist Naum Gabo, “Dada drummer” Richard Huelsenbeck, dancer Merce Cunningham, and writers William S. Burroughs, Christopher Logue, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. The other three recordings are The Young Turtle Assymetries, a one-of-a-kind performance piece for five voices, by Jackson MacLow; a text by Samuel Beckett, read by an actor; and dancer Merce Cunningham's Further Thoughts, consisting of extemporized responses to (unrecorded) questions from an interviewer.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-title">Aspen no. 5+6 included a reel of motion picture film, in the Super-8mm format.</h3>
      <p class="headline-text">On it were four short films by well-known artists, for about fifteen minutes of footage. All four films are included here in both QuickTime and Real Player formats. Though Aspen's film was silent, you can choose a soundtrack from among the forty audio exhibits.

      </p>
      <p> Rhythm 21 is a study in geometric composition by Hans Richter, in which variously-shaded rectangles grow, shrink, and alter their proportions. For a soundtrack, I like John Cale's Loop; Mario Davidovsky's In Memoriam Edgar Varese is a good choice too.

Lightplay, by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, is a montage of shining machine parts, filmed through a faceted lens and in multiple exposures. The apparatus on display is the artist's “Light display machine,” a kinetic sculpture constructed 1922-30. For a soundtrack, Alexander Scriabin's Prelude D Flat Major, Op. 11, No. 9 and his Prelude E Major, Op. 11 No. 15 are almost equally lovely. Neatly, they are of almost the same duration as the film clip.
Linoleum was conceived by Robert Rauschenberg as an ad hoc experiment in dance, “pedestrian movement,” and stage design. Among its highlights was a performer scooting across the stage “encased in chicken wire, surrounded by live white chickens, while munching on fried chicken,”

      <p> Loop, by John Cale, is a clever exercise for guitar and feedback that curves back on itself in two ways: the final groove in the record is continuous, repeating endlessly, and if you restart the recording you will find that the closing. </p>
