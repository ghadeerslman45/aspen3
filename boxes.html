    <h2>I doubt if any word in the English language is more capable of saying less about as many different subjects than the word "jazz."</h2>
   <p>
    The word seems to have been originally used in referring to the peccadillos of procreation. It was spelled "jass" at that time and one would think of it as an entirely different word, except that the first jazz band ever to record used it thusly on their first recordings: "The Dixieland Jass Band."
   </p>
   <p> The Victor Recording Company by using the language of love in identifying their product extended the usage of the word to denote peccadillos of music.

After the first few records, the word was changed to jazz and since then it has been used indiscriminately in referring to anything and everything, no longer confining itself to the coverage of biology and music. The term "all that jazz," meaning something on the order of "stuff and nonsense," illustrates pretty well the latitude of potential involved.
</p>
<p>
  However, it must be granted that in its employ as pertains to music, usage of the word is stretched to its utter dimension.

The word "pole" is used in alluding to opposite ends of the earth, for instance, and depending on which end one has reference to at the time, that end is properly and gracefully classified with a proper prefix, such as north or south, as the predicament calls for. This is done to somewhat relieve anonymity.
Not so in music. Jazz is Jazz.</p>

<p>The happy sounds of Dixie and the morbid laments and cliches of progressive (?) jazz (?) are lumped as one.

Couldn't we at least have a north jazz and a south jazz?

It seems that contemporary music, having become the antithesis of what the term "jazz" originally implied, would deserve some definite category.
</p>
<p>First, they called it bebop, then they called it rebop and then bop and then, either to give the mutilation meaning or to further the confusion, they called it jazz. But it's like I say, jazz is jazz.

On occasion, writers will refer to the product as "sound." These cats are getting close — one step farther and they'd have made it.

It has always seemed to me that instinct should be the criterion of jazz, in its rendition, as well as in the listening.

Today, analysis, strategy and science have become everything. Two and two is four, man. Don't Juilliard and Berklee say so!
</p>
<p>The old-time jazz man didn't know that two and two was four, this being true because he was instinctively aware of the fact that no two was ever equal to another two because no ones were ever alike.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, you can travel in space, using mathematics as a springboard, and you can produce music with an I.B.M. machine, but in my book, the boys in the Model Ts didn't do too bad by ear.
</p>
<p>
  I've seen a performer under this contemporary approach virtually wear out a trumpet in one chorus, playing everything from a bass part to a piccolo part on the same instrument.

Man, was I amazed! However, I'd much rather hear a guy like Beiderbecke play just one note, within the staff, or anywhere else for that matter. Jazz is Jazz. Mostly, I guess it's what people think it is. Some think it's taking a horn apart and putting it back together in one chorus of sixteen measures and some think it's holding a long, high note (preferably a little flat and without vibrato) for thirtytwo measures—and the longer you hold it the sooner it'll fit.
</p>
<h4>
  And techniques? Wow! But it's like Joe Marsala once said—"If you don't care what notes you use, who can't have a technique?"
</h4>
<p>
  The distance between notes has always seemed of importance to me—both up and down and sideways. Nowadays, they just bunch 'em up in all directions and goddam!
</p>
<p>

MY FAVORITE WAY OF listening to most of today's output is with a pair of tight-fitting earplugs and a pair of dark glasses, so you can't see anything much either, and then proceed to get loaded.

Rock and Roll has something, though— namely, the dancers—and one can get his kicks out of trying to think up some practical use for the twist.
</p>
<h4>It wasn't too long ago I attended a jazz (?) session in the modern idiom and had forgotten my dark glasses.</h4>
<p>Here are these cats, black glasses by the square foot, and wall-to-wall beards and they're playing the blues in B flat in the key of A. That is, they're playing it in B sharp and A at the same time. This is jazz, man, but only half as good as when they get all screwed up.

How they can tell when they're all screwed up, I don't know, but they can tell somehow and even through the beards and dark glasses you can tell they're all cheered up — soul music avant garde!</p>
<p>Now that they're completely fouled up and nobody knows where the hell they're at (except the audience) they really get crackin' and things get better all the time as anything fits anywhere and everything sounds the same as it did in the first place, except more so, and louder, which is really impossible, so the saxophone player evidently gets to feeling rather hopeless and casually drops out and one of the other guys, seeing this, figures it's the end and also drops out.

This is a hell of a good chance for the piano player, who hasn't been heard so far, and he bats his brains out for an indefinite period whilst the dropouts sit there growing beards.</p>
<p> Suddenly, but not too soon, the boys find out where they're at and figure it's a good time to have an intermission—while they're ahead. So this is what they try to do and in trying to stop they get so really fouled up it sounds like a special ending and this inspires the drummer to a fifteen minute solo.

</p>
<p>
  The rest of the band sits there and pick their noses, etc. for a quarter of an hour. Now the trumpet man takes off on a cadenza as a signal that the drummer is through with his solo, which everybody accepts except the drummer, so now the only thing left to do is to try to drown out the drummer, which they finally do, and now after another ten minutes of trying to find out who's got the ball, they finally get the ducks back in the pond and an intermission is had.
</p>
<p>
  They all meander over to a table where sits a chick (with dark glasses) who looks like an offspring of Lady Macbeth by Dracula. A round of introductions takes place wherein all the boys smile, thereby showing their teeth and giving their faces a much needed biological identity, and become seated, which offers another clue.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing much happens now for awhile and they just sit looking as if they'd just gotten through with inventing a tea kettle with a whistle on it, or something, until one heads for the powder room, another toward the bar and another for the cigarette machine, whilst the fourth one remains at the table with this Charles Addams weirdo and gazes into her eyes through two thicknesses of dark glasses — his and hers.
</p>
<p>
  Being in no mood to hear "How High the Moon" again in a multitude of keys simultaneously, I have me another snort and powder out before I have to call a tug boat to get me home.

As time goes by, I try to keep "tripped up" (that's the latest for "hepped up") by reading musicians' magazines and it seems that night clubs everywhere, generally speaking, are closing their doors or eliminating live entertainment. Personally, I think a few less beards and a little more music would tend to alleviate this situation.

</p>
<h4>
  For instance, there's this guy from Denver by the name of Dick Gibson who likes music.
</h4>
<p>Two years ago, wanting to hear some Dixie music, he laid out eight thousand bucks and hired some of his favorite musicians and had himself a bash in Aspen that wouldn't quit.

Now, last year, he was in the mood again and underwrote a bash for fifteen thousand smackeroos and at eighty-five dollars per ticket, he was sold out with calls for more.</p>
<p>
  This September, he's done it again, and it looks like a yearly bash. That's an example of what music will do for business and I venture to say there'll never be a beard in the place unless it's some cat with a complimentary ticket and if there happen to occur any flatted fifths, they'll be the bottled variety.

I wrote this mess, and from what I gather, it seems that I don't like beards and do like Dixie. Well, jazz is jazz, and I guess I'm stuck with the hairless variety.
</p>
<h4>FREDDIE FISHER: The author has this to say about himself:</h4>
<p>"I was born in 1904. Heard my first jazz music on a Mississippi riverboat named the Capitol. Decided then and there that I had to have a clarinet and have been trying to learn to play it ever since.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, none of the excursion boat music was ever recorded and what a pity. There was a cornet player named Emmett Hardy who was greater even than Bix, according to all musicians who ever heard him.

</p>
<p>
  "After saving up enough money to buy a tuxedo, I got a job in a band out of West Union, lowa—Harry Fitzgerald and his Troubadors and we troubadored, believe me!
</p>
<p>
  "Many bands later and smarter, I took up comedy and corn and wound up as Freddie "Schnickel-Fritz" Fisher and his band, making many records for Decca and quite a few movies. Got tired of the rat race known as Hollywood about 15 years ago and somehow found Aspen and stopped looking. Nowadays, I play mostly for kicks and manufacture jewelry. That's it."
</p>
<h3>
  	
Now wait a minute, Dad;
those young cats ain't all bad,
answers Jon Hendricks
</h3>
<p>
  When Freddie Fisher says, "I doubt if any word in the English language is more capable of saying less about as many different subjects than the word "jazz", he speaks more intelligently on the subject than many a so-called "jazz critic" has. I don't know about you, but that's my view. I take the position that the only critic of music is the musician.
</p>
<p>
  Continues Freddie: "The word seems to have been originally used in referring to the peccadillos of procreation." This statement contains a great and important revelation and I would like to delve into it in more depth, by way of explanation. In a work called "Evolution of The Blues," in which I had my say, I said it this way:
</p>
<p>
  "Now, in New Orleans when the French flag was unfurled, the Crescent City was known as 'The Paris of The New World,' a city wherein right from the start there was plenty of culture music, and art.
</p>
<p>
  "And in the evenin' when the work was done, the French let the slaves have a little fun. They blew a castoff horn and played a broken drum and let the rhythm cut loose some. And they always sang. They sang in the fields in the heat of the day. They sang in the evenin' when the day went away. They sang of work and earth and sod. In a brand new language they sang the praises of God. 'Though the church was new and the language was too the feelin' of children is always true, so the spirituals became the way of expressing the hope of a better day. 'Steal Away' could be taken differently if three or four of the children turned up missin' the very next day, and 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' made many a sad eye gleam when it meant that the Underground Railroad was runnin' full steam. Through spirituals the children could send messages while workin' with their shovels and hoes right under the master's nose.
</p>
<p>
  "Now, cities are sinful. There ain't no more to it. If you ever get a chance to move outa one, do it, 'cause when the children got to the cities they still sang the music of the church, but the words they was singin' left the church in the lurch. In the church, women are called 'Sister' and the music had no hues, but out side the church women became 'Baby' and the music became the Blues. Or, as the scholars would say: Spirituals are the music of earth and sod expressing the slaves' belief in God. Blues are the music of suffering and strife expressing the secular side of life."
</p>
<p>
  Now, don't ask me why they're called the blues, 'cause I don't know why. The only thing I do know is that Man on Earth is surrounded by sky, and the sky is blue, and from the blue sky the blue sea gets its hue. And when you stop to think about it some, even the blackest night ain't really black. It's dark blue! So, when you sing spirituals outside church, you gotta pay earthly dues so they become the blues, and when you play 'em on a horn a new music is born, a music that became very popular because of its infectious rhythm. Wherever it was played the players got the people swingin' with 'em. If you don't believe that's so you must've forgotten when they threw stones at Richard Nixon in Venezuela and a week later threw flowers at Satchmo. John Foster Dulles may have been Secretary of State but it was Satchmo who salvaged many a State Department date. And I certainly must include in this piece the fact that Dizzy stopped an anti-American riot in Greece. But for reasons too degrading to mention, this musical invention was removed from places like Congo Square, where people came from as far away as Europe to enjoy it there, and placed in houses of prostitution. Under those circumstances it became pretty hard to acknowledge it as a cultural contribution.
</p>
<p>
  This is what Freddie Fisher means when he speaks of "peccadillos of procreation." The chicks involved were not interested in procreation, but sensation. No one can refute the fact that the music which had been born in church had been systematically relegated to houses of ill repute. And the word "jass" or "jazz" didn't—and still doesn't, refer to the music at all, but to the sexual activity engaged in by the girls on call. American musicians— older and newer, still have to labor under the onerous connotation of a word that is less descriptive of music than of a sewer. In every American city it's still the norm to erect expensive opera houses glorifying a European art form.
</p>
<p>
  Yet, the young cats are the spiritual children of the old cats, and if the old cats don't like what the young cats do they really can blame no one but themselves, and I sincerely believe this to be true. It's comparable to the careless, immoral parents of today who do anything they care to, then refer to their children as "juvenile delinquents" when they do the things their parents do. The father is supposed to guide the child, but some of the old cats cut up pretty wild. Okay, so the only places where they could play the music was in joints where whiskey was sold by the cup, but did the old cats have to try their best to drink it all up? If a man is alotted 70 years in the Bible before he draws his last breath, how come so many older cats used to drink themselves to death? Just what is the difference between an old cat who takes a drink wherever and whenever he can grab it and the young cat with a heroin habit? Everything's faster these days, and heroin's quicker than liquor. Both seem, to me, a crime. Perhaps the difference is one of time.
</p>
<p>
  Still, I agree with Freddie that the average old cat is more musical and mellow than the average young fellow. At least in the old days the only experts were the musicians alone. Nowadays "critics" are crawling out of the woodwork and many of them have become widely known. And the service these "critics" have rendered to the art form they pretend to criticize is that they have cut it up more ways than two boardinghouse pies. Just what does the term "progressive" mean? Does it mean Stan Kenton playing atonally and dissonantly loud enough to draw a crowd, then, when everybody got hip to what was goin' on in his head, quittin' the scene declaring, "Jazz is dead"? But he met his Waterloo and time was his Wellington. Long live Duke Ellington!
</p>
<p>
  And what about the young cat who is advised by critics that he should attend schools to learn where he's at? There's an old saying: "If you don't like it, you can lump it," but to me it's downright silly of a young cat to walk past Louis' and Dizzy's and Bobby Hackett's house on his way to learn how to play the trumpet, or to pass Coleman Hawkins with his axe on his way to learn how to play sax. When it comes to this music we unfortunately call jazz, these men and others are the only schools, and students of this music who learn in any other are fools.

However, blanket condemnations of "modernists" are dangerous, 'cause you might overlook the contributions of the cats who have attained high position because they have carried forward an old and honorable tradition. I refer, in the main, to Miles Davis, Horace Silver and John Coltrane. About Miles we need not waste word. He is out of Diz via Bird. His playing sometimes attains a poignancy that moves one to tears. He is the most individual trumpet stylist in years. One could not refute this if he tried. It cannot be denied.
</p>
<p>
  Less well-known is the contribution of Horace Silver, whose groups have always created a sensation and who is the Duke Ellington of this generation, since it is wellknown that virtually all the compositions his groups perform are his own. The sound Horace created with the original Jazz Messengers was so down that both Horace and Art Blakey work successfully using what is basically the same sound.

About John Coltrane let me make myself clear. Like him or not, he is playing faster than most of us can hear. If it took us 300 years to get Bach into our brain, you can figure how much longer we have to go before we hear John Coltrane. I'm sure if he thought about it the prospect would wig him, but he'll have t'be done split a longer time than Bach before some of us dig him. But one thing y'gotta keep in mind: He ain't ahead. We're behind. About 'Trane many adverse criticisms are heard, but, if memory serves me correctly, it was the same way with Bird. Some people complain that 'Trane plays too loud. Yes, he plays loud. You bet! But has there been a better way to attract a lethargic crowd? Not yet! I have a theory, and some may call me a fool, but I think that inept and unartistic imitators trying to play like 'Trane started the whole avant-garde school. They heard just enough of 'Trane to dig that he had a newer, faster way, but they never did dig that first you have to know how to play. They're not hip to the fact that 'Trane played Rhythm-and-Blues dues. I have an idea what the term "avant-garde" means on today's music scenes, so I wanna warn you that it means "before you put your guard up I'm gonna whip this swindle on you an' by the time you get hip to the fact that I done messed up your head, I will have made me enough bread."
</p>
<p>
  So there's a lot the old cats could have taught the young cats if they had been more aware, but too many cats, old and young, just don't care. To say that one type of music is better than another is like saying a child is better than its mother. Music in the old days is warmer in many ways, but so were those days. There was love abroad in the land, so musicians brought that love up on the bandstand. And it wasn't a business so much then, but still an art. "Commercialism" has torn music and musicians apart. Then the union stepped in and stopped cats from jammin' and that's when all the open doors started slammin'. Cats went into competition with one another and each one forgot his brother. The young cats forgot the days and times of old and got so cool they got downright cold.

So, let's keep the best of the new ways and put it with the warmth and feeling of the old days and have a ball, 'cause I'd rather have bad music than no music at all.

  JON HENDRICKS: Singer, drummer, shortstory writer and poet, Jon Hendricks is one of the top jazz Iyricists. Everything he writes (including this article) has a strong jazz beat—or as Jon says, "Take a little time and you'll find a little rhyme." As middleman in the trios of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross and Lambert, Hendricks & Pavan, he became sort of the James Joyce of Jive.
</p>
<h4>	
Just what is this thing
called jazz?
Note by note,
Chuck Israels takes it apart</h4>
<p>
  	
Freddie Fisher and Jon Hendricks have attempted some definition of what is apparently a confusing word. Mr. Fisher tries an etymological analysis of the word "jazz" and Mr. Hendricks tries to pin things down by some history and naming of names. Here is the most concise working definition of the word "jazz" that I can come up with (it is far from the most complete):

Jazz is a method of making music. It is a method which produces a music with a characteristic highly syncopated rhythmic feeling. It usually has room for improvisation within the framework of the harmonic structure of the piece as laid down by the bass, piano, and/or guitar, which, together, provide a kind of contemporary basso-continuo foundation for the music.
</p>
<p>
  While this may seem to be a broad definition, at least it excludes what is not jazz. Anything contained within the boundaries of this description is jazz of one sort or another. This definition excludes evaluations. It does not tell you whether the music is good or bad.

Dixieland and progressive jazz both fall within this definition, along with all the other myriad kinds of jazz music. Discussions of these particular musical differences are questions of style.

The word "Dixieland" describes certain easily recognizable characteristics of a music. There is a more or less typical Dixieland instrumentation: at least three horns in the front line—usually clarinet, trumpet, and trombone —and a rhythm section that may include banjo and tuba. The melodies and their embellishments are of a predominately diatonic nature, the harmonies are essentially triadic in character, and the rhythms are felt in simple and clear syncopations against a two-beat (to the bar) rhythm section.
</p>
<p>
  Besides this, there is a characteristic ensemble formula which is often heard in Dixieland bands in which the trumpet plays the melody, often quite freely; the clarinet improvises an eighth note obbligato over the melody; and the trombone plays a bass line in half and quarter notes (sometimes called "tailgate" for reasons that make a picturesque story but are tangential to the musical facts).

Not all of these characteristics at once are necessary to make a Dixieland sound; remember, now we are talking about a "style"— an amorphous, changeable combination of ideas and executions which is only vaguely defined and whose boundaries defy solidification. The best we can do to suggest what this style is like is to aim somewhere around the middle and take a pot shot.
</p>
<p>
  What is called "progressive jazz" also covers a multitude of sins and saintly acts. It is bounded on the rear guard by some things called "mainstream" and "swing music" (notable as the only famous monarchy in the usually democratic music world); on the avant-garde by many noise makers and happenings makers but too few music makers (I have never been able to figure out what those happenings makers were good for since happenings seem to be happening all the time without their precious assistance); and flanked on all sides by commercial musics which borrow from its vocabulary, like Bossa Nova, American popular music of many kinds, and even a companion blues music with which it shares a mutually nourishing relationship.
</p>
<p>
  I've taken a shotgun blast all around the shape of progressive jazz because the center of it is so busy with variants that it is harder to characterize than Dixie. However, there is a rich musical vocabulary available within the progressive jazz styles which make use of a multitude of subtle shadings of melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic relationships. These variations, within the style, are so profuse that to say that the melodies are chromatic, the harmonies based on complex chords, and the rhythms highly syncopated is not very helpful. All that is generally true.

Jazz has moved and changed style at an amazingly rapid rate trying to catch up with centuries of development in classical music in the short space of about sixty years. Whether or not it has "progressed" is not exactly the question here. A more complex style is not a guarantee of better communication and artistic results.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Fisher has a preference for one style of jazz music—Dixieland. He describes a jazz session of the most unattractive, anti-social, uncommunicative, and formless sort and then labels it "progressive." The musicians that Mr. Fisher heard may well have been just as bad, if not worse, than the picture he paints of them. They may even have been playing in a modern jazz style. But the essential fact is that they are bad musicians—not that they are progressive jazz players.

The characteristics of any good music fall into two general categories: those which convey emotional qualities, and those which convey a sense of form, giving the emotional content a shape to ride on and helping to make the feelings understandable to someone besides the person who is playing.

The most important thing about the emotional qualities is that they must be there. The artist must be in intimate contact with those spontaneous elements of his personality in order to give a creative and meaningful performance.
</p>
<h3>
  The formal elements of music are the structure through which the artist makes his feelings understandable to other people.
</h3>
<p>
  Let me amplify that statement because I think it will help clear up some of the stylistic questions involved in these discussions of jazz—and it may even shed some light on the murky gloom of the jazz avant-garde.

Form is not always necessary for expression. There is a great range of human feeling that can be expressed without language or any kind of intellectual knowledge. Babies cry in pain or gurgle in contentment; men roar in anger or smile in pleasure. Love, hate, fear, and tenderness are basic experiences in the lives of everyone and are communicable in the most direct and universal ways. But, and this is a large "but" in this particular discussion, in order to go further with communication and express the individual idiosyncrasies of human experience, we need a more sophisticated structure and language which is accepted and understood by the expressor and his audience.
</p>
<p>
  If this seems to be a rather obvious fact, I can hardly argue the point. However, many have embarked on lengthy discussions of art as if this element of understood language did not exist at all as an intrinsic part of a communicative artistic experience.

If we look at this consideration specifically in terms of music, it follows that the musician with the largest musical vocabulary and the most complete control of musical grammar and syntax, can best express the subtle variations of feeling that make up his personality. But here's the rub. Where are the listeners to this music? Are they aware of the artist's language? Do they understand it?
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, in my experience with the jazz audience, I must admit that they do not. The world of jazz is sadly lacking in educated listeners. Music is a demanding language to begin with. It cannot be well understood without disciplined and dedicated concentration. What has been heard must be accepted and retained in order to understand what is to follow, and there is no going back to catch up.

In order to understand jazz, some knowledge and experience with musical formn is necessary. Most of us have that knowledge from our daily lives. It is hardly possible to live without exposure to many different kinds of music. Now what about listening? How about carrying over the results of one experience in order to more fully understand the next one?
</p>
<p>
  Labels arid names are conveniences which can serve well to sort out and define, or serve badly to pigeonhole and limit. You don't have to be able to talk about music to be able to appreciate it. The essential kind of educated listening is characterized by a growing recognition of parallel cases, regardless of whether or not one is able to specify one's experiences with labels.

When I was in school there was a sign in our rehearsal room that said, "Music is a picture painted on a background of silence." I remember how right I felt about that sign admonishing us to quiet, but as I am writing this now I see an essential concept that was missing from that statement—it is time, as well as silence, on which music is painted.
</p>
<p>
  What a fortune of subtleties abound in the .temporal elements of music. How are we measuring musical time? By drumbeats? By clocks? By heartbeats? By instinctive comparison to other temporal experiences? How long is your attention span, you listener to music? Can you concentrate throughout an entire composition or is your attention span limited to a 60-second television commercial? How fine are your perceptions? Have you heard that note before? Was it held longer this time? Has this whole pattern been heard before?

These are considerations which we are all taught in secondary school music appreciation class. They are some of the elements which make up musical language. Along with pitch, timbre, and dynamic variations they are the elements of universal musical form.
</p>
<p>
  I have been talking in a general way about music and everything I've said is applicable to. Iistening to jazz. Balance and proportion and clarity of thought and expression within a historically understandable musical language are all part of good jazz. But along with these elements, there are some specific characteristics to be found in jazz which give it its special flavor and feeling.
</p>
<h4>
  The rhythmic vocabulary of the jazz musician is highly syncopated.
</h4>
<p>
  Jazz derives much of its impetus from the contrast between the rhythms of the soloists and the generally steady pulsation of the bass and drums. The rhythm section provides measured jumping off points against which the soloist builds a varied pattern of counter-rhythms. The comnlexity and variety of these rhythmic relationships vary with the style—but the process and the essential relationships between soloist and rhythm section are the same for progressive jazz as for Dixieland.
</p>
<p>
  The bass and piano or guitar also provide a continuous harmonic carpet on which the soloist walks his crooked miles. This background has a repetitive structure, agreed upon in advance according to the composition being played. This background, moving through time, serves as the springboard for the melodic relationships in the music. This pattern, which keeps everybody playing together, exists in the same essential form and is used in essentially the same way in both modern jazz and in Dixieland; again, with varying degrees of complexity of relationships.
</p>
<p>
  These, then, are the processes or methods of jazz. Within these methods, there is some improvisation—actually a great deal of it, but generally less than most people, even some highly trained classical musicians, seem to think. And this improvisation is of a sort that is highly disciplined and contained within a given framework of musical "rules." How each musician realizes these "rules" is what makes up his personal style. He may be highly educated and mechanical in his manipulation of musical sounds, or naive and instinctively spontaneous, or highly educated and highly spontaneous, or naive and very mechanical. A high degree of musical information does not guarantee that the holder of this information is able to use it artistically, nor does a lack of musical education guarantee good musical instincts. A great jazz artist educates himself in the best use of the biggest musical vocabulary he can handle and proceeds to fit that vocabulary into the most satisfying frameworks he can find in the most spontaneous possible way, each time he performs.
</p>
<p>
  Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Barney Bigard have all developed this art to a beautiful degree of perfection. So have Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Lester Young, Clifford Brown, Stan Getz, Miles Davis, and Bill Evans. As a jazz composer, Duke Ellington has created some of the most rewarding pieces of music in America and they stand equally well as songs and as structures for improvisation. Bill Evans has also written many good jazz pieces, each of which has its own special character. Evans' pieces are very defined as structures for improvisations and they retain their unified character even during the improvisations, because each structure is a natural development of one or two musical ideas to which Evans limits himself at the conception of the composition. By incorporating the germinal musical idea into the harmonic structure of the piece on which the improvisations are built, Evans achieves a personality for each of his compositions.
</p>
<p>
  Stan Getz has had a great deal of long-deserved exposure in the last three years and is one of the greatest jazz players of all time. He plays the saxophone with an incredible combination of beauty and virility and has one of the widest emotional ranges of any performer I have ever heard. He can project enormous power, generate great heat and excitement, and in the next breath evoke tenderness or a cry of pathos. All this he does while drawing beautifully organized forms, treading that thin line which keeps the natural from sounding banal and obvious, and the spontaneous from sounding chaotic and absurd.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, it is not the color of the socks that Lester Young wore at some historic record date, or the personal habits and problems of some troubled musicians, or the eccentric and sometimes anti-social behavior of one or another group of musicians, that make jazz history. Those are the things which require no expense of energy on the part of the listener to understand and are therefore accessible to a great number of uncommitted people. Those things make for idle discussion and momentary attention.

It is the artistic content of the music, which requires dedicated digging on the part of the listener, which remains to make a permanent impression on the music of the world.

    <h2>The Aspen Braille Trail was built high up in the Independence Pass wilderness, at 10,400 feet, by a small band of Aspenites and White River Forest Service personnel.</h2>
    <p>Robert B.

    </p>
    <p>
      We are informed at the outset that no poisonous plants, insects or reptiles inhabit this tract of land, which is to say that there are only good vibrations. Touch, taste and smell! Our sight has blinded us to many of the marvels of the natural world, since it has anesthetized our other senses. Oddly, the wonders of the natural world are even more wondrous when experienced without sight.

The 23 trail markers were written by Dr. Alfred Etter, naturalist and conservationist, and our picture captions are excerpted from them.

    <h4>Station 1: Highway end of trail</h4>
    <p>Welcome to the Roaring Fork Braille Trail! This is a cooperative effort of certain citizens of Aspen and the White River National Forest which we hope will add another dimension to the life of the blind and the life of the nation. This trail through a spruce and fir forest is designed with two ideas in mind: that people need to know the feel of nature, and that the natural world needs people who understand it and will speak out for its protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though you are in the midst of some of the wildest country in America, and even though you may want to walk unaccompanied, you will be safe. You will be guided by a wire. There are wires on both sides of the path, and you can reach from one wire to the other in most places.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 2: Bridge entrance, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      Nature speaks to all of us. Glorious western landscapes await discovery not only by the average tourist, but by the tourist who, deprived of sight, can sense the glories of nature by the way they feel, sound, or smell, or in new combinations of wind, humidity, and temperature. Each of you will bring back different impressions. Each of you will feel things differently, detect different odors, and hear different songs cast on the air by the birds or insects that will be your new companions. All these cannot be named or described on the Braille cards, but remember that the names of natural things are man-made, and real understanding and enjoyment do not depend on knowing a man-made name, but in sensing the variety of nature and the fascinating manner in which all the living things in an environment are tied together in a web of life. To put you completely at ease, there are no poisonous plants, insects, or reptiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are about to cross a thirty-foot bridge over the Roaring Fork River. Stop midway at the signal, and listen to the many stories this river has to tell.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 3: Mid-bridge, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Roaring Fork is a mountain stream that tumbles over rocks, rapids, and waterfalls in its quest for the sea. Its waters come from melting snows and mountain storms, from altitudes above 14,000 feet, from the rooftop of America. Sixty miles from here, at Glenwood Springs, the Roaring Fork adds its waters to the famous Colorado River. Though this splashing, noisy water may seem a hazardous place to try to make a living, the trout finds its home here, and a small bird, the water ouzel or dipper, splashes in and out of the water, sometimes walking underwater as it finds aquatic insects which support it. Sometimes you can hear it singing very joyfully like a mockingbird or wren. It sings all year round, even when the river has become a mass of ice with only a few openings at falls and rapids.
    </p>
    <h4>Station 4: End of bridge, right</h4>
    <p>
      As you face the wire, reach out before you and feel the foliage of the trees among which you will be walking. This one is a fir. Its needles or leaves are flat and bluntpointed, not at all prickly. Were you to be here in winter, the snow might be three feet deep, but the fir would still have its leaves and would still be making food with the help of winter sunshine. The fir is one of our favorite Christmas trees, because the needles do not fall off. In nature, when the needles do fall, they leave only a small scar on the twig. Smooth twigs help identify the fir.
    </p>
  
    <p>Probably you have already smelled the balsam aroma in the woods. Crush a leaf from the fir in your fingers and smell it. Vegetation, identified by its fragrance and feel, can serve anyone as a cheap altimeter in the mountains because different species of plants grow at different elevations. This tree is called "sub-alpine" fir, perhaps because it doesn't grow at the very tops of the mountains, but most commonly between elevations of 9 to 11,000 feet. Here you are at an altitude of 10,400 feet.
    </p>
    <h4>Station 5: 8 steps, right</h4>
    <p>
      Meet the spruce in front of you. It is not so friendly as the fir. The leaves, or needles, are prickly. The stems from which the old needles have fallen are rough with little pegs, the bases of old needles. Spruce needles seem to be four-sided when you roll them in your fingers. There is a different smell, also. Spruce is less fragrant. Spruce and fir live together around the world in cool climates with abundant snow.
    </p>
   
    <h4>Station 6: 15 steps, right</h4>
    <p>Handle the common juniper with care. It is even more prickly than the spruce. Never a tree, it spraggles about at the edges of the forest like a poorly arranged bouquet. Like the spruce and fir, it too lives the world around in snow belts. The tall, steeple-like evergreens avoid the snow by shedding it. The juniper accepts it, bending and disappearing beneath the cool cover during winter. Summer and winter, it provides a haven where small animals like squirrels and snowshoe rabbits can secrete themselves, guarded by its prickly needles.
    </p>
   
    <h4>Station 7: 11 steps, left</h4>
    <p>You cannot help noticing the softness of the path upon which you are walking. The spruce and fir have laid a carpet before you. They create their own environment wherever they grow, shading the soil and covering it with acid needles that decompose slowly, thus preventing most other species of plants from getting a foot, or rather, a root-hold. Kneel down and finger the forest floor. Feel the millions of needles, the deep cushion they have built. It insulates the soil, holds moisture, and covers the mountains with a blanket of protection from havy rain and freezing and thawing which soon denude a bare slope. The water of the Roaring Fork is clean and sparkling. The spruce and fir help keep it that way.</p>
   
    <h4>Station 8: 7 steps, left</h4>
    <p>
      You are being watched — by a dozen eyes, at least. Squirrels and birds live in this woods. It is their home. They know every inch of it. They have their hiding places picked out in case of danger. They know where to go for their feed. Each bird gleans a different part of the tree; the chicadee searches the small twigs for insects and their eggs. The brown creeper explores the main trunk. The red or pine squirrel lives here, and at the foot of this marker, you will find a squirrel "midden." Plunge your hands into it. It is cool and flaky, made up of dismembered spruce and fir cones. Each has been handled by a hungry squirrel searching for the seeds hidden beneath the cone scales. These "middens" or "dumps" pile up beneath his favorite feeding places. He also stores cones here for the cool moisture keeps them from opening and dropping out the seeds. Cones are good indicators of humidity. When it is humid, they remain tightly sealed.
    </p>
    <h4>Station 9: 18 steps, left</h4>
    <p>
      Is the noise you hear the wind or the river? The roar of the Roaring Fork is muted now by the many trees that separate you from the river. On windy days, the wind may make a greater noise.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 10: 11 steps, right
    </h4>
    <p>
      Kneel down and feel the remains of an old tree. It did not die a natural death. The forests along the Roaring Fork were cut during the last century, but the stumps remain. Slowly nature returns them to the soil and new trees take their place. Slowly the cycle of birth, life, death, decay, and rebirth is completed, making it possible for living things to continue living, to spread into new places and to change. Feel the top of the stump carefully with your fingers. Can you feel the concentric rings, the corrugations? Each ring is a year's growth. Count them if you have the patience. If you don't, the age of this tree is carved in Braille on the right side of the stump. (200 years, approximately) By tapping the wood of the stump, you can sense its rottenness. You can feel where the decaying wood blends into the soil around it. You may feel a little roughness on the wood. These are lichens, about which you will learn more at Station 12.
    </p>
    <h4>
    Station 11: 4 steps, right and left
    </h4>
    <p>
      The trail narrows here to pass between two trees. Feel the trunk of the spruce on the left. It is scaly and rough. Then feel the trunk of the fir on the right. It is smooth and has little bumps on it which are often like blisters. They contain balsam oil, which is a rich, clear liquid used to mount biological specimens on microscope slides. We are more dependent on nature than we realize.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 12: 11 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      A rock is an unlikely place to start a garden, yet many wild gardens begin there. Feel the rock at your feet. It is not all rock. Part of it is covered with plant growth, though it does not feel like an ordinary plant with leaves. It is only a scaly covering on the rock, but it is a garden just beginning. It is a lichen, which is not really a single plant, but a company of plants, living and working together. It takes cooperation to make a living on granite. In the beginning both plants are microscopic. One of them is a green alga that can make food from sunlight, a sprinkling of dust, and a little moisture. The other is a grey, white, or black fungus that lives off the dead cells of the alga, or the substances it produces as it grows. The two plants grow intertwined, the one providing food, the other holding moisture and providing support. It is a little like one man holding a ladder while another man climbs on it.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 13: 12 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      At the last station the lichen-covered rock was in the open, washed by rain, windblown, and sun-scorched. For nutrition it received only a little dust from the atmosphere. The lichen may have taken more than a hundred years to grow. The rock before you is protected from the wind and sun. It receives a constant rain of organic matter from the trees above, needles, tiny but continual flakings from the new twigs and old bark, pollen and fallen flowers, the excrement of insects and birds, the gnawings of ants and beetles. Slowly the rock is buried. Drought-resistant, acid-loving plants like blueberries grow on the rock. You can feel them sprouting from the thin soil. On such poor "land" they will make only tiny blueberries.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 14: 13 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      Perhaps you noticed a different feel in the path as you came to this station. You are standing on the moldering corpses of old trees. The wood has rotted with the help of moisture from a hillside seep and the continual digestive action of molds of many kinds which convert dead wood into living tissue, occasionally even mushrooms. These molds, or fungi, are then converted in turn by some other organism, skunk, chipmunk, bacterium, or insect, into organic waste that is passed around to be reused again, perhaps by a new generation of trees, or the plants twining among the rotting wood fibres. Smell the wet wood. No cleaner smell exists. Marvel that decay can be so clean.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 15: 20 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      Here is a log to sit on. Rest and listen before you return to the noisy Roaring Fork for the sounds of the spruce and fir forest. What you hear will depend greatly upon the time of year, the time of day, and on whether it has rained. You may hear the chatterinq of the squirrel or the distant calling of an olive-sided flycatcher from the pinnacle of some tall spruce. To some it seems to say, "Come right here." Miners who have come out of the dark tunnels in the mountains may think it says, "Three Cheers!" More imaginative souls hear, "Quick, three beers!" The chicadee may call his name, or the dry nasal note of the nuthatch may be heard. Occasionally the whirring and whistling of the tiny hummingbird intrudes on the quietness of flowered places. Softest of all, audible only to the keenest ears, is the whispering flight of the hawk moth as it hovers at the mouth of a purple gentian, drinking.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Station 16: 16 steps, right
    </h4>
    <p>
      At your feet is a rug. It is cool and full of water. It is a moss, called "sphagnum" or "peat" moss. It is found round the world in bogs where the water is continually cold. It forms vast peat deposits in some areas but here it is only a thin mat that thrives because of the seepage of cold water from the mountain. Put your hands into the everwet, evercool tangle. Little wonder gardeners use this moss to hold water around the roots of plants during shipment, or in hanging baskets. It has even been used in times past for surgical dressings and "wildwood" diapers because of its absorbent and sterile character. The next few feet of trail are covered with another interesting plant. It is a little matforming plant of cold climates that is seldom seen growing anywhere but along with sphagnum moss, and where cold water seeps below the soil. It is creeping wintergreen. It really is green all winter. In the fall it is covered with bright red berries. You may get a taste of wintergreen from its leaves.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 17: 9 steps, right
    </h4>
    <p>
      At the base of this tree you will find a large wound in the trunk. It was put there by a porcupine, an animal characteristic of the spruce-fir forest, but also found in the pinonpine forest of lower elevations. They subsist on the bark of trees in the winter, and sometimes cause considerable damage. At the present time, their activity is especially notable since most of their natural enemies such as the coyote and bobcat and fisher have been poisoned or trapped out of large expanses of forest country. Don't worry about encountering a porcupine. He will run, or rather, waddle, away from you. The next trail segment goes downhill toward the Roaring Fork.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 18: 12 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      The descent you have just made will remind you that a river is a living, working thing. It is continually deepening its valley. Once it was running at the level of the last station. Now it is before you, at your feet. By carefully bending down you can put your hands in the cool water. You can feel stones polished and smoothed by water and washing sand. Given time the Roaring Fork will grind and roll these stones until there is nothing left except sand grains, silt, clay, and chemicals. These will be washed, in turn, into the Colorado, through the Grand Canyon, and eventually, after many delays in reservoirs created by Boulder Dam and Glen Canyon Dam, to the Gulf of California and the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps as you stand here in this valley, dwarfed beneath valley walls over 2,000 feet high, you can imagine the time it has taken to carve away all the solid rock that is no longer here. During the ice age, which now is believed to have ended some 10,000 years ago, glaciers grew and melted in this valley time and again. The tremendous weight of the grinding ice helped to speed the cutting of the valley. On the hillsides, it is possible to find grooves and scratches made by stones embedded in the glacier ice. The stones you feel here at the river's edge could tell a fantastic story if they could only speak.

    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 19: 1 step, right
    </h4>
    <p>
      You may sit down on a little bench of soil. It is very sandy soil, as you can feel. It was deposited here during a period of high water on the Roaring Fork. The sand is all that remains from many boulders rubbed away to nothingness by time and the river. This sandy soil offers a different kind of place for plants to grow. You can identify three kinds of bushes here. The first is willow, about waist high. You can tell it by its smooth, varnished stems. The next is bog birch, a little taller. Its stem is less smooth, almost sandy. The next, shrubby cinquefoil, is knee height. Brush your hand across the tops of its branches and feel the feathery foliage.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 20: 15 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      One tree that we have not mentioned stands before you. Grasp the bushy branches that feel for all the world like a bottle-brush. This is the lodgepole pine. Because it often grows in dense stands and is tall and straight and clear of branches, it was probably a favorite building material for both Indians and mountaineers. Feel each cluster of needles. There are two in a cluster. Some pines have five. Feel along the branches for developing cones. The lodgepole grows on areas that are dry and sandy, on bare rock areas, and especially where fires have swept through. Its cones only open on the hottest and driest of sites, or when a fire comes close enough to greatly lower the humidity.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 21: 10 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      Jump on the soil. Note how springy it is. You are walking across the lower end of a bog, which is a wet area built up by the gradual addition of mats of moss and soil. It is a fascinating place to study plant life. Every day we walk on many wonders of nature. Grass grows between the cracks of a sidewalk, or in our yards. In this open area you walk among many interesting kinds of plants, each with its own history of living in this world. If you will kneel down facing the wire, you can run your hand over some of these creations. Possibly you can find plants with triangular, three-sided stems. These are the sedges. There is a couplet that helps us remember, "Sedges have edges, and rushes are round." But not all round stemmed plants here are rushes. There are many others. By consulting the Braille key hanging to your right, you may identify some of them.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 22: 13 steps, right
    </h4>
    <p>
      Before you is a box of cones. They are the fruiting bodies of the evergreens. They are of different sizes and shapes. Spruce cones may be two or three inches long, and cylindrical. When they are new, or wet, they are rolled up tightly and feel like a short cigar, but when they are dried out, the cone scales open outward and release the enclosed seed. Fir cones are very similar in appearance, but very few of them will be found in this woods. They commonly stay on the trees until they disintegrate. Lodgepole cones are conical. They stay on the tree for a long time, unless the red squirrel chooses to cut them off. In the three boxes on the right are the cones of spruce, fir, and lodgepole pine. In smaller boxes are the seeds of these same three trees. Can you identify them?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Station 23: 15 steps, left
    </h4>
    <p>
      This is the last station. The largest tree along the Braille Trail stands in front of you. Reach around it. A tree is a remarkable thing, structured to solve many problems, yet somehow attractive to human beings and to many other forms of life besides. Some trees stand alone, but most are a part of a forest, as each of us is a part of a community of living things. We are all interdependent. Nature is constantly at work in many ways and in many images to carry on the continuity of life that makes this earth unique and interesting. We have many neighbors around us who were here long before we came. In our management of the earth we must make room for them. In the scheme of things there is little doubt that they are as important as we.

      “It may very well be that in our conscious inner lives, the interplay among our senses is what constitutes the sense of touch. Perhaps touch is not just skin contact with things, but the very life of things in the mind.”
    </h5>
    <h5>
      “It begins to be evident that ‘touch’ is not skin but the interplay of the senses, and ‘keeping in touch’ or ‘getting in touch’ is a matter of a fruitful meeting of the senses, of sight translated into sound and sound into movement, and taste and smell. The ‘common sense’ was for many centuries held to be the peculiar human power of translating one kind of experience of one sense into all the senses, and presenting the result continuously as a unified image to the mind. In fact, this image of a unified ratio among the senses was long held to be the mark of our rationality, and may in the computer age easily become so again.”
    </h5>
    <h5>
      “Fragmentation by means of visual stress occurs in that isolation of moment in time, or aspect in space, that is beyond the power of touch, or hearing, or smell, or movement. By imposing unvisualizable relationships that are the result of instant speed, electric technology dethrones the visual sense and restores us to the dominion of synesthesia, and the close interinvolvement of the other senses.”

    <p>Of course it had to happen, it really had to happen, it was the natural end to Beethoven's Ninth. Everyone was getting sicker and looking like a wolverine while the people pushed colleges. Dirty buildings with lawns for people to lie on blankets. Well-groomed wasps or purposefully disheveled sensitives reading Spengler. But meanwhile everything was dead. Writing was dead, movies were dead. Everybody sat like an unpeeled orange. But the music was so beautiful.</p>
    <p>
      All the bastards that you were supposed to feel sorry for and fight wars for were screaming, "Look at the freaks in Central Park with transistors up their heads. " Tom Wolfe drew clever cartoons and people admired his vocabulary, forgetting he was dead and sucking blood. William B. Williams, circa 1400, appeared on David Susskind, benevolent, genial ("Please don't hate me, I must play the devil's advocate") trying to put down Phil Spector, maker of the beautiful music with those beautiful drum tag endings, Phillie's drummers reaching at the end of each chorus for the moment. And William B. wanted to tell Phil about coloured music, with his slick parted hair and tie pins and Nat King Cole mumblings.
    </p>
<p>
  And through all those years were those beautiful rock groups, tweeting and chirping like mesmerized sparrows, and if you weren't dead, you psyched in now, because it was now and no one had made a good book, a good movie, just bullshit over and over. Only the music, and now Robert Lowell, up for a poetry prize without a decent word ever written. The only decent poetry of this century was that recorded on rock-and-roll records. Everybody knew that. Who you going to rap with. Little Bobby Lowell or Richard Penniman alias Little Richard, our thrice-retired preacher. The incomparable E. McDaniels, otherwise known as Bo Diddley.
</p>
<p>
  Giving Robert Lowell any kind of poetry prize is obscene. Ditto worrying about Ezra Pound. And the Yale Poetry series. The colleges are meant to kill. Four years in which to kill you. And if you don't extend your stay, the draft, by and for old people, waits to kill you. Kill your instincts, your love, the music. The music is the only live, living thing. Draft only those over forty. It's their war, let them kill each other.
</p>
<p>
  The music going on and on. When Johnny Ace died, everyone was sad. Black arm bands in school. The early fifties, the first race music to make it to N. Y. white station. Alan Freed, the great father, clipped, fast speech and table pounding. The Jesters, Diablos, Coney Island Kids, Elica and the Rockaways. Old people in Hollywood rock-and-roll movies wearing their pants around their nipples.
</p>
<h3>
  ""OOOOooooooohhhh wwwwhhhheeeeeee oooohhh,
it's later for you baby. "
</h3>
<h3>
  ""Fred you can't go to N.Y. and expect to live on $75 a week. "
</h3>
<p>
  The dead way of doing it, it, the word it, no talking, titillation, but no coming across. And William B. Williams knows coloured music. The only poetry of the last 20 years was and is in the music on the radio. The colleges have to be destroyed. They're dangerous. Music appreciation courses. Metaphysical poetry. Theology. Playboy jazz polls. Tests. Papers. Psychological tests. Doctors trying to "cure" the freaks while they gulp pills. Rushing with the music. It's the music that kept us all intact. It's the music that kept us from going crazy. Folk music. That's music on the radio. You should have two radios. In case one gets broken. Live music is bad these days because records are better. Life in a speaker.
</p>
<p>
  Rock-and-roll gobbled up all influences. Better blues musicians than the folk blues people. Better electronic music than the electronic people (i.e. England's the Who; N.Y. 's Velvet Underground.) Classical music's so simple. Really, anyone can write it. Anyone. It's a phase like teething. If you tie a contact mike to a new-born baby and spin it by the umbilical cord, think of the sound. The freaks are winning, there's no doubt about it, everyone better empty their pockets.
</p>
<p>
  In the fifties there was the four chord school, C, Am, F, G. If you knew these you could play 400 songs and the top 20 - "Blanche, " "Why Don't You Write Me, " "In the Still of the Night. " Elvis was three chords, E, A, B. 7 billion groups, the music was inescapable, it sank into everyone's blood and Fender was the guitar. Then for awhile bullshit music. Pat Boone. Pat Boone imitating, covering every Fats Domino and Little Richard Record, putting down the freaks. White bucks and Columbia Teachers College ("I'd rather see my children dead than live under communism"). Balding Pat.
</p>
<p>
  woke up this morning with a feeling of despair
looking for my baby and she wasn't there
heard someone knockin and much to my surprise
there stood my baby lookin in my eyes
crazy little momma come knock knock knockin
just like she did before
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya yae yi yayayayayaya
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeiaeeeee

<p>
  How can they give Robert Lowell a poetry prize. Richard Wilbur. It's a joke. What about the EXCELLENTS, Martha end the Vandellas (Holland, Dozier, Holland; Jeff Barry, Wile Greenwich; Bachrach and David; Carol King and Gerry Goffin, the best song-writing teams in America. ) Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with THE CHORDS. Phil Spector being made out to be some kind of aberration when he put out the best record ever made, "You've Lost that Lovin Feeling. "
</p>
<p>
  We all made love to the music. And the word love was used and used and used in all the music. Over used, again and again, because that's where it was at. Still lingering idiots over Cole Porter, cheap cocktail sentiment and wit, Julie Styne, Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hammerstein.
</p>
<h4>
  ""Shake it up baby."
</h4>
<p>
  Bo Diddley, unheralded genius of our time, who developed guitar techniques and sounds that just now are being appropriated.

Today you know music when you play. But there'd be nothing now without then. And there was a reaction against the Broadway music, middle of the road radio cretin music. How sad Richie Valens died. Give him a prize.
</p>
<h3>
  ""ooohhhhhh Donna
ooohhhhhh Donna"
</h3>
<p>
  Have you ever listened to "You've Lost That Lovin Feeling, " where the girls are saying oohhhh and suddenly, naturally, just right, come in with "Baby, " against Bill Medley's building vocal line. Repetition. Every head in America must know the last three drum choruses of "Dawn" by the Four Seasons. Paradiddles. Repetition.
</p>
<p>
  Repetition is so fantastic, anti-glop. Listening to a dial tone in Bb, until American Tel & Tel messed and turned it into a mediocre whistle, was fine. Short waves minus an antenna give off various noises, band wave pops and drones, hums, that can be tuned at will and which are very beautiful. Eastern music is allowed to have repetition. That's ok for glops with strawhats and dulcimers between their blue legs... they don't listen to it, or see it, but they sanction it. Andy Warhol's movies are so repetitious sometimes, so so beautiful. Probably the only interesting films made in the U. S. Rock-and-roll films. Over and over and over. Reducing things to their final joke. Which is so pretty.
</p>
<h4>
  ""Sally go 'round the roses
roses they won't hurt you"
</h4>
<p>
  The North American glop. The freaks are making it finally but they must unfortunately have glops around, it seems, to protect them. Lawyer glops, accountant glops, publicity glops, recording glops. But they will be done away with.
</p>
<h4>
  ""One Monkey Don't Make No Show"
</h4>
<p>
  The N. Y. radio scene is so awful. A record won't be played unless it's already #.07 all over. All over has phenomenal records no one in N.Y. gets to hear. There's great music in the hills.
</p>
<p>
  Hey, don't be afraid. The toy hippies generating excitement over THINGS. Junior Groupies. Future glops. But the music goes on and the ranks go, and they're converts, 47-year-old Madame Bouschelle, and the kids coming up are already three-year-old acid heads who need to be touched a long time to make it. Flaming Negroes in colorful African depression dresses bouncing to Otis Redding. Electricity. Why does a wall switch work. Work. Ohm. The power of the plastic people supplying their Dacron music. But this is good. Dacron is good, plastic is great and the music is all. People should die for it. People are dying for everything else so why not the music. It saves more lives. Glops invent polio vaccines and solve kidney problems. They collect urine in bottles and analyze it, test it out for glop diseases. Old wig women with varicose tongues plop from one foot to another DANCING but the real people are coming up fast. Real because they're here now alive, while the others are dead, and because they wouldn't give Robert Lowell a poetry
</p>
<p>
  prize either. That kind of beauty was wrong, fake, and didn't exist. It was manufactured so it could be taught. It was a myth perpetrated by pedants seeking tenure. But the tradition's finally broken. The children are stroking their knees and wearing World War I jackets. "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away. " You've got to watch. The music is sex and drugs and happy. And happy is the joke the music understands best. You'd better take drugs and learn to love PLASTIC. All different kinds of plastic, pliable, rigid, colored, colorful, nonattached plastic.
</p>

  ""Sittin here la la

  If if if if when she had come ba ba back anyone could have seen the color of her walls. Ultra sonic sounds on records to cause frontal lobotomies. Have our own record on network radio across the country and have the sound blow up the APPARATUS. A take over. N.B.C. is mine. General Sarnoff demoted. Page boy glop to the Diablos. Sunrise Semester with the Harptones ("I need a Sunday kind of love, a love to last past Saturday night. ") Sally Passion in green flesh paint undulating, her earrings, arched hands, convalescing with my mind ("I'll be the rainbow when the sun is gone, wrap you in my colors to keep you warm").
</p>
<h3>""Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa oooohhhh mow mow
Pa Pa ooohhhh mow mow"</h3>
  <p>
    California plastic people came up with California plastic chord changes. Which meant sticking in a Bb before your G, and after your C. Jan and Dean, the Beachboys, as opposed to Negro cooings in the East with shiny saxophones, California plastic concentrated on white twirps and falsetto chirps. (Sidewalk Surfin - the angel chorus- "shake your B. . .uns.") The cult of the celestial choir. There is no god and Brian Wilson is his son. Brian Wilson stirred up the chords. Deftly taking from all sources, old rock, Four Freshman, he got in his later records a beautiful hybrid sound, ("Let Him Run Wild," "Don't Worry Baby," "I Get Around," "Fun, Fun, Fun -- and she had fun, fun, fun till her daddy took her t-bird away"). Like demented unicorns the East went West, and, it, all, made, it. It wasn't really a long cry from such early classics as "Peppermint Stick" by the Elchords (in N.Y. there are stores which sell old rock records for as much as $500).
  </p>
  <p>
    The old sound was alcoholic. Spirit high. In the early 50's and early 60's pot high music. We're already past the A head, acid tripper stage. But plastic. You can hear it in the music. You can get high on the music, straight. Music's never loud enough. Taxi drivers listen to the news and worry about muggings. You should stick your head in a speaker. Louder, louder, louder. Do it Frankie do it. Oh, how, how. Oh do it, do it. The glops are wearing your clothes now and listening. Someone should paint them in azure stripes and mail them somewhere. It's like holding your arm rigid in a furry black sweater, with your hand bent so it seems amputated. When you straighten it out you get a present on two counts.
